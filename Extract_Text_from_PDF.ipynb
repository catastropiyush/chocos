Humphries,*a Motoaki Matsuo,b Guanqiao Lia and Shin-ichi Orimoab\\n\\nComplex transition metal hydrides have potential\\n\\ntechnological application as hydrogen storage\\n\\nmaterials, smart windows and sensors. Recent exploration of these materials has revealed that the\\n\\nincorporation of anionic hydrogen into these systems expands the potential number of viable\\n\\ncomplexes, while varying the countercation allows for optimisation of their thermodynamic stability. In\\nthis study, the optimised synthesis of Na2Mg2TH8 (T = Fe, Ru) has been achieved and their thermal\\ndecomposition properties studied by ex situ Powder X-ray Diﬀraction, Gas Chromatography and\\n\\nPressure-Composition Isotherm measurements. The temperature and pathway of decomposition of\\nthese isostructural compounds diﬀers considerably, with Na2Mg2FeH8 proceeding via NaMgH3 in a\\nthree-step process, while Na2Mg2RuH8 decomposes via Mg2RuH4 in a two-step process. The first\\ndesorption maxima of Na2Mg2FeH8 occurs at ca. 400 1C, while Na2Mg2RuH8 has its first maxima at\\n420 1C. The enthalpy and entropy of desorption for Na2Mg2TH8 (T = Fe, Ru) has been established by\\nPCI measurements, with the DHdes for Na2Mg2FeH8 being 94.5 kJ mol(cid:2)1 H2 and 125 kJ mol(cid:2)1 H2 for\\nNa2Mg2RuH8.\\n\\nTransition metals are renowned for their diverse range of\\nvalence states and structural conformations.1,2 As such, in the\\nlast five decades a swathe of homoleptic transition metal\\nhydrides have been synthesised to determine their potential\\nfor technological applications. Mg2NiH4 was first realised\\nfor its reversible hydrogenation properties in 1968,3 and has\\nsince been investigated for a variety technological applications\\nincluding smart windows and sensors.4–7 Mg2FeH6, with a\\ngravimetric hydrogen storage content of 5.5 wt% has since\\nbeen developed,8–14 along with a host of other transition metal\\nhydride congeners and derivatives.1,2,15–22\\n\\nThe transition metal hydrides of Group 8 often form octa-\\nhedral [TH6]4(cid:2) anions, of which are limited to four-fold coordi-\\nnation by counterions (M) in the form of M+M0+M00+M0 0 0+,\\nM2+M0+M00+, M3+M0+, M2+M02+M00+. Expanding the diversity of\\ncoordination can be achieved by increasing the anionic charge\\nof the system, for instance by the inclusion of H(cid:2).

As a con-\\nsequence, the influence of H(cid:2) on the thermal stability and\\ndecomposition process of these materials is generally unknown\\nand must be understood. As such, ex situ powder X-ray diﬀraction\\n(PXD) and Pressure-Composition Isotherm Measurements (PCI)\\nhave been conducted. Their temperatures and pathways of decom-\\nposition have been established and the associated enthalpies and\\nentropies of H2 desorption have been calculated and compared to\\nliterature values.\\n\\nExperimental\\n\\nAll preparation and manipulation was performed in a Miwa\\nglove box filled with purified argon (o1 ppm O2 and the dew\\npoint of H2O below 190 K) to avoid contamination.\\n\\nThe synthesis of Na2Mg2FeH8 was carried out by two methods:\\nS1 followed a four step process, which first required the synthesis\\nof Mg2FeH6. This was achieved by mechanically milling (Fritsch\\nPulverisette 7) MgH2 (hydrogen storage grade, Sigma Aldrich) and\\nFe (99.99%, Mitsuwa) powders at a molar ratio of 2 : 1 for 2 h at\\n400 rpm (ball-to-powder ratio 40 : 1), under argon with subsequent\\nheat treatment of the pelletised powder at 400 1C for 20 h under\\n3 MPa H2. The resultant olive green powder was then mechani-\\ncally milled with NaH (95%, Sigma Aldrich) at a molar ratio of\\n1 : 2 for 20 h under argon (S1-BM) with subsequent heat\\ntreatment of the pelletised powder at 400 1C for 20 h under\\n30 MPa H2. The product was yielded as an olive green powder.\\nThe synthesis of S2 (Na2Mg2FeH8) followed a two-step pro-\\ncess. NaH, MgH2 and Fe powders at a molar ratio of 2 : 2 : 1 were\\nmechanically milled for 20 h at 400 rpm (ball-to-powder ratio\\n40 : 1), under argon (S2-BM) with subsequent heat treatment of\\nthe pelletised powder at 400 1C for 60 h under 30 MPa H2.

PANalytical HighScore Plus\\nv. 3.0, DICVOL,30 CHEKCELL31 and GSAS32,33 were used for\\nphase identification, indexing, space group identification and\\nRietveld refinement, respectively.\\n\\nA GC323 (Gas Chromatography) (GL sciences Inc.) was used\\nto detect the desorbed H2 by means of a TCD detector, with a\\ncolumn temperature of 200 1C.

In\\norder to reduce the time requirements and levels of impurities,\\nalternative synthetic routes were investigated. It was deter-\\nmined that successful synthesis is achievable by ball milling\\n2NaH + MgH2 + Fe (S2-BM), followed by hydrogenation at\\n30 MPa H2 at 400 1C (eqn (3)), with an associated time require-\\nment of 80 h. The products after milling of each material diﬀer\\nconsiderably (Fig. 1), the constituents of S1-BM, identified by\\nPXD are not altered during milling (Mg2FeH6 + NaH) despite\\na broadening of the peaks due to a decrease of crystallite size\\n(or reduced crystallinity).34 The products of S2-BM were\\nNaMgH3 + Fe.35\\n\\nFig. 1 PXD of ball milled samples S1-BM (Mg2FeH6 + 2NaH), S2-BM (2NaH +\\n2MgH2 + Fe) and S3-BM (2MgH2 + 2NaH + Ru) and hydrogenated samples of\\nS1-3. l = CuKa. * = Na2Mg2TH8 (T = Fe, Ru); # = Mg2FeH6; @ = NaH; x = T\\n(Fe, Ru); $ = NaMgH3; ^ = NaOH; + = Mg; B MgH2; ! = unknown phase.\\n\\nThisjournalis©theOwnerSocieties2015Phys.Chem.Chem.Phys.,2015,17,8276--8282|8277Open Access Article.

Analysis of hydrogenated S1 by Reitveld refinement\\nindicates that the sample is 80.3(9)% pure and as such contains\\nresidual Mg2FeH6 (8.9(4)%), Fe (7.9(2)%), NaMgH3 (2.5(3)%)\\nand NaH (2.7(2)%) starting materials. Analysis of hydrogenated\\nS2 indicates that the sample contains 90.6(4)% Na2Mg2FeH8\\nand 9.4(3)% Fe, without residual Mg2FeH6 or NaH. This\\nindicates that the optimal method of synthesis is via the S2\\nmethod due to the elimination of the prerequisite Mg2FeH6\\nsynthesis (eqn (1)) and overall decrease in impurities compared\\nto S1, primarily due to the initial (complete) formation of NaMgH3\\nduring the milling reaction.

The onset of decomposition for\\nNa2Mg2FeH8 occurs at ca. 280 1C, with the first maxima being\\nobserved at ca. 400 1C, and the second at ca. 430 1C. Decom-\\nposition concludes at ca. 475 1C. Conversely, the onset of H2\\ndesorption for Na2Mg2RuH8 occurs at ca. 325 1C, with the first\\nmaxima being observed at ca. 421 1C, and the second at\\nca. 460 1C. H2 is no longer detected after ca. 500 1C.\\n\\nTo ascertain the pathway of decomposition, ex situ PXD was\\nconducted on samples heated to selected temperatures in vacuo\\n(Fig. 2b and c). Analysis of Na2Mg2FeH8 after heating at 360 1C\\nindicates a miniscule quantity of Na2Mg2FeH8\\nresides,\\nalthough the majority has decomposed into NaH, Mg and Fe,\\nwhile NaMgH3 is also detected. By 400 1C NaH has decom-\\nposed, while only Mg and Fe are observable by PXD. Na is not\\nobserved due to the low vapor pressure of Na at elevated\\ntemperatures. No further changes to the material are observed\\nat higher\\ntemperatures. Therefore the decomposition of\\nNa2Mg2FeH8 is determined to occur according to eqn (5)–(7).\\n\\nNa2Mg2FeH8 - 2NaMgH3 + Fe + H2\\n\\n(1.3 wt%)\\n\\n2NaMgH3 + Fe - 2NaH + 2Mg + 2H2 + Fe\\n\\n(2.5 wt%)\\n\\n2NaH + 2Mg + Fe - 2Na + 2Mg + Fe + H2\\n\\n(1.3 wt%)\\n\\nNa2Mg2RuH8 was first heated to 320 1C, where PXD determined\\nthat decomposition has not yet started. By 420 1C full decom-\\nposition appears to be complete, with Mg3Ru2 and Ru being the\\nproducts. At this temperature, NaH instantly decomposes to Na\\nand evaporates from the sample. As a result, the decomposition\\nof Na2Mg2RuH8 is determined to occur according to eqn (8)\\nand (9). Presumably the excess Ru required to form Mg3Ru2\\n(without leaving excess Mg) comes from the excess Ru that\\nremained in the starting material.\\n\\nNa2Mg2RuH8\\n\\n- 2NaH + 2/3Mg3Ru2 + 3H2\\n\\n(3.0 wt%)\\n\\n2NaH + Mg3Ru2 - 2Na + Mg3Ru2 + H2\\n\\n(1.0 wt%)\\n\\nPCI analysis of Na2Mg2TH8 (T = Fe, Ru) (Fig. 3a and b) enables\\nthe intricacies of the decomposition process to be truly under-\\nstood. The experiments on Na2Mg2FeH8 were conducted at\\ninitial pressures of 30 MPa and 400 1C, mimicking conditions\\nused for synthesis. Consequently, it was ascertained that the\\nfirst thermal reaction according to eqn (5), occurs at an\\nequilibrium pressure of 15.5 MPa, releasing ca. 0.8 wt% H2 at\\n400 1C (Fig. 4a). PXD analysis of the products recovered at\\n6 MPa characterised the products to be NaMgH3 and Fe\\n(Fig. 3e). DHdec for this process was determined by means of\\na van’t Hoﬀ plot of H2 desorption equilibrium pressures and\\nthe linear fit (R2 = 0.975) to the data to be 93 kJ mol(cid:2)1 H2\\n(Fig. 3c), while the corresponding DSdec was calculated as\\n180 J mol(cid:2)1 H2/K. However, at lower temperatures this step is\\nkinetically hindered and as a result DH and DS may be obscured.\\nThe values reported above are an average of the plateau pressures.\\nThe further two equilibrium plateaus below 1 MPa H2 corre-\\nspond to the decomposition of NaMgH3, exhibiting mass losses\\nof 2.5 and 1.5 wt% for eqn (6) and (7), respectively. The overall\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n(7)\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nhydrogen content released was therefore determined to be\\n4.7 wt% at 400 1C (theoretical maximum of 5.1 wt%). DHdec\\nwas calculated to be 87 and 111 kJ mol(cid:2)1 H2 for the latter two\\nprocesses, in accord with the literature values.36 The corres-\\nponding DSdec also agreed with literature values with 132 and\\n158 J mol(cid:2)1 H2/K for eqn (6) and (7), respectively. Therefore\\nDHdes for the entire system is surmised to be 378 kJ mol(cid:2)1\\n(94.5 kJ mol(cid:2)1 H2). The identity of the species at each decom-\\nposition stage was determined by PXD by ending selected PCI\\nexperiments at specified pressures. Fig. 3e illustrates the final\\nproducts after the PCI experiments conducted at 360 and\\n400 1C and also those observed after the first and during the\\nsecond equilibrium step (eqn (6)). During the second equili-\\nbrium step, NaMgH3, Fe and NaH, and Mg are observed,\\nindicating that NaMgH3 is decomposing. After the third equili-\\nbrium (final products), Na, Mg and Fe are the main constituents,\\nalthough residual NaH is also observed. Therefore the decom-\\nposition process can be described according to eqn (5)–(7)\\nand Fig. 4.\\n\\nThe thermal stability of Na2Mg2FeH8 is enhanced compared\\nto that of Mg2FeH6, which exhibits a H2 desorption maxima at\\nca. 360 1C (Fig. 2) with an associated DHdes of 261 kJ mol(cid:2)1.29\\nThe additional stability achieved by the incorporation of Na+\\nand H(cid:2) into the compound, induces a significant increase in\\ndesorption temperature maxima to 400 1C and a total DHdes of\\n378 kJ mol(cid:2)1 (Fig. 4). This value correlates very well with the\\nprevious DFT calculations conducted on this compound, which\\ndetermined DHf to be (cid:2)328 kJ mol(cid:2)1.23\\n\\nIn contrast to Na2Mg2FeH8, Na2Mg2RuH8 is stable above\\npressures of 0.19 MPa H2 and T 4500 1C (Fig. 3a). PXD analysis\\nof material annealed at 6 MPa H2 and 450 1C (Fig. 3f) indicates\\nthat the only modification is the disappearance of the unknown\\nphase (observed after initial synthesis (Fig. 1)) which is replaced\\nby another unknown phase. This material can be indexed to an\\northorhombic unit cell of a = 14.5331, b = 7.9841 and c = 6.2429\\nand crystallises in a possible space group of Pmmn, although\\nstructural identification is inhibited by the low concentration\\nand weak intensity of the Bragg peaks. As was observed from\\nthe GC results (Fig. 1), decomposition is also noted to follow a\\ntwo-step decomposition route by PCI. At 500 1C, the first\\nplateau is observed at an equilibrium pressure of 0.19 MPa,\\nwhile the second occurs at ca. 0.07 MPa. Each step was\\ndetermined to have an associated mass loss of ca. 1.9 wt%,\\nwith a total of 3.8 wt% H2 being desorbed out of a maximum\\ntheoretical capacity of 4.0 wt%. This process was also carried\\nout at 475 and 450 1C. This allowed for DHdes and DS to be\\ndetermined to be 131 kJ mol(cid:2)1 H2 and 176 DS (J mol(cid:2)1 H2/K),\\nrespectively for step 1 (R2 = 0.984) and DHdes = 119 kJ mol(cid:2)1 H2\\nand DS = 151 DS (J mol(cid:2)1 H2/K) for step 2 (R2 = 0.999) (Fig. 3d).\\nTherefore DHdes for the entire system is surmised to be\\n500 kJ mol(cid:2)1 (125 kJ mol(cid:2)1 H2). PXD of the products at each stage\\nallows a greater insight into those determined by ex situ heating in\\nvacuo. After the first plateau, a substantial level of Mg2RuH4 is\\nidentifiable in the powder, along with Ru, NaOH and a small\\nquantity of Mg3Ru2. The highly oxidisable Na (residual after eva-\\nporation) is the source of NaOH (occurring during PXD analysis),\\n\\nThisjournalis©theOwnerSocieties2015Phys.Chem.Chem.Phys.,2015,17,8276--8282|8279Open Access Article.

This was achieved by mechanically milling (Fritsch\\nPulverisette 7) MgH2 (hydrogen storage grade, Sigma Aldrich) and\\nFe (99.99%, Mitsuwa) powders at a molar ratio of 2 : 1 for 2 h at\\n400 rpm (ball-to-powder ratio 40 : 1), under argon with subsequent\\nheat treatment of the pelletised powder at 400 1C for 20 h under\\n3 MPa H2. The resultant olive green powder was then mechani-\\ncally milled with NaH (95%, Sigma Aldrich) at a molar ratio of\\n1 : 2 for 20 h under argon (S1-BM) with subsequent heat\\ntreatment of the pelletised powder at 400 1C for 20 h under\\n30 MPa H2. The product was yielded as an olive green powder.\\nThe synthesis of S2 (Na2Mg2FeH8) followed a two-step pro-\\ncess. NaH, MgH2 and Fe powders at a molar ratio of 2 : 2 : 1 were\\nmechanically milled for 20 h at 400 rpm (ball-to-powder ratio\\n40 : 1), under argon (S2-BM) with subsequent heat treatment of\\nthe pelletised powder at 400 1C for 60 h under 30 MPa H2. The\\nproduct was yielded as an olive green powder.\\n\\nThe synthesis of Na2Mg2RuH8 followed a two-step process.\\nMgH2, NaH and Ru (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory)\\nwere mechanically milled (identical parameters as employed\\nwith Na2Mg2FeH8) at a molar ratio of 2 : 2 : 1 for 20 h under\\nargon (S3-BM), before subsequent heat treatment of the pelletised\\npowder at 500 1C for 20 h under 30 MPa H2. The product was\\nyielded as a light grey powder.\\n\\nPowder X-ray di\\ufb00raction (PXD) measurements were con-\\nducted using a conventional X-ray di\\ufb00ractometer (Lab-PXD,\\nPANalytical X\\u2019Pert-Pro, CuKa radiation) in flat plate mode. Data\\nwere collected using a X\\u2019Celerator X linear position sensitive\\ndetector within a 2y range of 10\\u2013901 using 0.021 steps at 0.041/s\\nwith X-ray generator operating conditions of 45 kV and 40 mA.\\nThe PXD samples were loaded in an Ar glovebox and the sample\\nholder covered by Mylar film to prevent oxygen/moisture con-\\ntamination during data collection. PANalytical HighScore Plus\\nv. 3.0, DICVOL,30 CHEKCELL31 and GSAS32,33 were used for\\nphase identification, indexing, space group identification and\\nRietveld refinement, respectively.\\n\\nA GC323 (Gas Chromatography) (GL sciences Inc.) was used\\nto detect the desorbed H2 by means of a TCD detector, with a\\ncolumn temperature of 200 1C. Samples were heated at a rate of\\n5 1C min(cid:2)1 under an Ar flow of 40 ml min(cid:2)1.\\n\\nTypical Pressure-Composition Isotherm Measurements\\n(PCI) were conducted inside custom-built manometric appara-\\ntus, where the sample cell was placed in a furnace and heated\\nto the desired temperature at a hydrogen pressure of 6 MPa or\\n30 MPa. The experiment was controlled by software developed\\nby Suzuki Shokan Co., Ltd.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The NiB nanoparticles were\\nsynthesized by chemical reduction method and a typical\\nsynthetic route was as follows: 0.06 g PVP was dissolved in\\n$6H2O. After\\n100 ml aqueous solution containing 2.38 g NiCl2\\nstirring for 30min, 100 ml aqueous solution (pH \\u00bc 11) con-\\ntaining 1.08 g KBH4 was dropwise added into the above solu-\\ntion under vigorous stirring. An ice bath was used to control\\nthe reaction temperature, after that, the solution was kept on\\nstirring for 1 h. Then the resulting black precipitate was\\n\\ufb01ltered out from the solution, the as-synthesized product was\\nthoroughly washed with distilled water and acetone several\\ntimes to reduce any residual reagents. Finally, the powder was\\nfurther dried at 60 (cid:1)C in vacuum for 12 h. And the composition\\n\\nof the as-prepared NiB was quanti\\ufb01ed by inductively coupled\\nplasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (ICP-9000).\\n\\nThe mixtures of MgH2 and NiB in a weight ratio of 9:1 were\\nmilled using a planetary ball milling device at the rate of\\n450 rpm. The balls to powder ratio was 40:1 by weight, and the\\nmilling time was 5 h at room temperature. All the materials\\nwere handled in a glovebox \\ufb01lled with puri\\ufb01ed argon\\n(99.999%), which can keep the water vapor and oxygen levels\\nbelow 1ppm by a recycling puri\\ufb01cation system to prevent\\nsamples from hydroxide formation and/or oxidation.\\n\\nThe hydrogen desorption properties of all the milled\\nsamples was evaluated with a temperature-programmed\\ndesorption system (TPD, PX200), the analysis was performed\\n(cid:3)1 high-\\nby using 2 (cid:1)C/min heating rate and a 35.1 mL min\\npurity argon (99.999%) \\ufb02ow rate.\\n\\nThe hydrogen desorption/absorption kinetics properties of\\nthe milled mixtures were studied by using a commercial Sieverts\\ntype apparatus. 100 mg sample was sealed into the stainless\\nsteel reactor in the argon glove box. The hydrogen desorption\\ntests were carried out in the range of 0.001e0.01 MPa hydrogen\\n(99.999%), and the temperature range of the measurements was\\n230e300 (cid:1)C. Pressure-composition-isothermal\\n(PCI) experi-\\nments were recorded at 250 (cid:1)C, 270 (cid:1)C, 300 (cid:1)C to study the\\nthermodynamics of the MgH2-10 wt%NiB mixtures.\\n\\nIn addition, we also used a high-pressure differential\\nscanning calorimetry technique (HP-DSC) to investigate the\\neffect of co-milling nano-NiB on the hydrogen sorption ther-\\nmodynamics of MgH2. The test was carried out by a TA\\nInstruments Q20P HP-DSC system. Sample pans were\\nprepared and pressed inside the argon glove box, an empty\\npan was used as reference. Then the sample pan and refer-\\nence pan were loaded into the cell at room temperature under\\nto\\nambient atmosphere as soon as possible to limit\\na minimum the exposure of the sample to air, after that, the\\nwhole system was purged three times with puri\\ufb01ed argon and\\nthen with high purity hydrogen. Afterward, the cell was\\npressurized with high purity hydrogen (99.999%). The heating\\nrate was 5 (cid:1)C/min, and the temperature range was \\ufb01xed from\\n200 (cid:1)C to 400 (cid:1)C, respectively. The onset temperature and\\nhydrogen pressure were monitored and recorded by the TA\\nUniversal Analysis software program.\\n\\nThe structural analysis of the reactants and products\\nbefore and after the PCT measurements was carried out by\\nXRD using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku MiniFlexII) with Cu\\nKa radiation. In order to avoid exposure to air, each sample for\\nXRD analysis was prepared on a sample holder and covered\\nwith a protective \\ufb01lm in the glove box. S-200 scanning electron\\nmicroscope (SEM, Cambridge Instruments) was employed to\\nobserve the morphology of the samples. Also, all the samples\\nwere handling in the glove box to avoid exposure to air and\\nthen transfer to the SEM sample chamber as soon as possible.\\n\\n3.\\n\\n\",\n          \"\\n\\nDielectric  barrier  discharge  plasma  (DBDP)  assisted  ball  milling  is  a  special  type  of  ball  milling,  in  which  an \\n\\nauxiliary  electrode  covered  by  an  insulating  medium,  is  located  in  the  center  of  the  ball  milling  jar.  During  the  ball \\n\\nmilling,  a  high  voltage  is  applied  to  the  space  between  the  electrode  and  the  jar  wall  to  ionize  the  atmosphere  and \\n\\nproduce  the  plasma.  Compared  to  the  conventional  ball  milling,  DBDP-assisted  ball  milling  constitutes  a  more \\n\\neffective  method  to  make  powder  fragmentation  and  alloying  because  of  its  extra  heat  explosion  and  high-energy \\n\\n  \\n\\nelectron impact effects on the powder during the ball milling. \\n\\nThe  powders  of  Mg,  Ga  (99.9%,  Alfa  Aesar)  were  weight  out  in  mole  ratio  of  5:2.  Mg5Ga2  was  prepared  by \\n\\nvacuum  induction  melting  in  a  magnesia  crucible  under  the  protection  of  a  pure  argon  atmosphere.  After  cooling  to \\n\\nroom  temperature,  the  ingots  were  pulverized  with  a  hammer  until  powder  go  through  200  mesh  sieve.  Since  the \\n\\nMg(Ga) solid solution may be formed at a high temperature, MgH2 (99.6%, Alfa Aesar) and Mg5Ga2 were mixed at a \\n\\nweight ratio of 10:1, as the solid solubility of Ga in Mg is 5 wt% at 573 K.   \\n\\nThe  phase  structures  of  all  of  the  samples  were  characterized  by  a  Philip  X\\u2019Pert  Pro  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD) \\n\\ninstrument  with  Cu  K\\u03b1  radiation  (\\u03bb  =  0.15406  nm).  To  prevent  the  oxidation,  the  samples  were  covered  by  a  liquid \\n\\nparaffin wax or a transparent protective film (3M Company). The lattice constants were calculated from the XRD data \\n\\nby using the Rietveld model and employing the X'Pert Highscore Plus software. In-situ XRD test was carried out by the \\n\\nPhilip X\\u2019Pert Pro XRD instrument with high-temperature accessories. It used Cu K\\u03b1 radiation (\\u03bb = 0.15406 nm) and \\n\\nthe Scan range is 20\\u00b0~60\\u00b0. Before heating, sample chamber was purged by pure Ar for 1 hour. During testing, sample \\n\\nwas also protected by Ar. \\n\\nThe  (de)hydrogenation  behavior  was  characterized  by  pressure-composition-isotherm  (PCI)  measurements  at \\n\\ndifferent  temperatures  using  a  commercial  Sieverts  type  apparatus  (Gas  Reaction  Controller,  Advanced  Materials \\n\\nCorporation). Approximately 0.3g powder sample was loaded into a sample holder in the glove box. To calculate the \\n\\nenthalpy change (\\u0394H) and the entropy change (\\u0394S), the H2 pressure in the middle of desorption pressure plateau of the \\n\\nmeasured PCI curves was taken as the value of the plateau pressure for the van\\u2019t Hoff plot.   \\n\\nDifferential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC,  Netzsch  STA  409DC)  was  used  to  measure  the  dehydrogenation \\n\\nthermostability  of  the  Mg-Ga  alloy.  The  heating  rate  is  2  K/min.  Lastly,  the  Johanson\\u2013Mehl\\u2013Avrami\\u2013Kolmogorov \\n\\n\\f(JMAK) equation was used to calculate the activation energy of the dehydrogenation process.   \\n\\n3. \",\n          \"\\nAll preparation and manipulation was performed in a Miwa\\nglove box filled with purified argon (o1 ppm O2 and the dew\\npoint of H2O below 190 K) to avoid contamination.\\n\\nThe synthesis of Na2Mg2FeH8 was carried out by two methods:\\nS1 followed a four step process, which first required the synthesis\\nof Mg2FeH6. This was achieved by mechanically milling (Fritsch\\nPulverisette 7) MgH2 (hydrogen storage grade, Sigma Aldrich) and\\nFe (99.99%, Mitsuwa) powders at a molar ratio of 2 : 1 for 2 h at\\n400 rpm (ball-to-powder ratio 40 : 1), under argon with subsequent\\nheat treatment of the pelletised powder at 400 1C for 20 h under\\n3 MPa H2. The resultant olive green powder was then mechani-\\ncally milled with NaH (95%, Sigma Aldrich) at a molar ratio of\\n1 : 2 for 20 h under argon (S1-BM) with subsequent heat\\ntreatment of the pelletised powder at 400 1C for 20 h under\\n30 MPa H2. The product was yielded as an olive green powder.\\nThe synthesis of S2 (Na2Mg2FeH8) followed a two-step pro-\\ncess. NaH, MgH2 and Fe powders at a molar ratio of 2 : 2 : 1 were\\nmechanically milled for 20 h at 400 rpm (ball-to-powder ratio\\n40 : 1), under argon (S2-BM) with subsequent heat treatment of\\nthe pelletised powder at 400 1C for 60 h under 30 MPa H2. The\\nproduct was yielded as an olive green powder.\\n\\nThe synthesis of Na2Mg2RuH8 followed a two-step process.\\nMgH2, NaH and Ru (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory)\\nwere mechanically milled (identical parameters as employed\\nwith Na2Mg2FeH8) at a molar ratio of 2 : 2 : 1 for 20 h under\\nargon (S3-BM), before subsequent heat treatment of the pelletised\\npowder at 500 1C for 20 h under 30 MPa H2. The product was\\nyielded as a light grey powder.\\n\\nPowder X-ray di\\ufb00raction (PXD) measurements were con-\\nducted using a conventional X-ray di\\ufb00ractometer (Lab-PXD,\\nPANalytical X\\u2019Pert-Pro, CuKa radiation) in flat plate mode. Data\\nwere collected using a X\\u2019Celerator X linear position sensitive\\ndetector within a 2y range of 10\\u2013901 using 0.021 steps at 0.041/s\\nwith X-ray generator operating conditions of 45 kV and 40 mA.\\nThe PXD samples were loaded in an Ar glovebox and the sample\\nholder covered by Mylar film to prevent oxygen/moisture con-\\ntamination during data collection. PANalytical HighScore Plus\\nv. 3.0, DICVOL,30 CHEKCELL31 and GSAS32,33 were used for\\nphase identification, indexing, space group identification and\\nRietveld refinement, respectively.\\n\\nA GC323 (Gas Chromatography) (GL sciences Inc.) was used\\nto detect the desorbed H2 by means of a TCD detector, with a\\ncolumn temperature of 200 1C. Samples were heated at a rate of\\n5 1C min(cid:2)1 under an Ar flow of 40 ml min(cid:2)1.\\n\\nTypical Pressure-Composition Isotherm Measurements\\n(PCI) were conducted inside custom-built manometric appara-\\ntus, where the sample cell was placed in a furnace and heated\\nto the desired temperature at a hydrogen pressure of 6 MPa or\\n30 MPa. The experiment was controlled by software developed\\nby Suzuki Shokan Co., Ltd.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
